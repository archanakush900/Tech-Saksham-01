          <h4>MIX OF EMOTIONS</h4>
          <p>
            1. Anger, frustration, blame, hopelessness and fear, are common
            reactions to unwanted change and these feelings are usually
            uncomfortable and difficult to manage.

            2. Naming our emotions is a simple and effective way to help us
            unravel what we are experiencing. Saying out loud is even more
            powerful.

            3. If possible, put it in a sentence like this: ‘I’m really worried
            that my child isn’t going to be able to complete their subject.’ ‘I
            am frustrated with the powerlessness of the situation.’ ‘I am angry
            that this has happened.’

            4. Mood Swings-can be a part of growing up. One minute you feel like
            you’re on cloud nine, and the next you feel like you want to scream
            your head off. Your body is being rushed with a whole bunch of new
            hormones that create a host of emotional changes during puberty. It
            can feel hard to keep up

          <h4>BREAST ENLARGEMENT</h4>
          <p> 1.Girls usually begin puberty between the ages of 8 and 13 years
            old. The earliest sign of puberty in most girls is the development
            of breast "buds," nickel-sized bumps under the nipple.

            2. It is not unusual for breast growth to start on one side before
            the other. It's also common for breast buds to be somewhat tender or
            sore. Uneven breast growth and soreness are both totally normal and
            usually improve with time.

            3.Massaging the breasts won’t affect their size. Massaging too hard
            might even hurt the breasts or irritate the skin and nipples.

            4.Coarser hair will begin to grow in the genital area, under the
            arms, and on the legs. In some girls (about 15%), pubic hair may be
            the first sign of puberty―showing up before breast budding starts.

            5.Breasts are mainly made up of fatty tissue rather than muscle, so
            exercise won’t affect breast development. However, exercise in
            general will help keep the pectoral muscles behind the breast in
            shape, as well as help toning the body. It’s important to wear a
            sports bra that fits you well and supports your breasts during
            exercise.

          <h4>ADOLSECENT MALE </h4>
          <p> 1.Voice changes may happen, as the voice gets deeper. Sometimes,
            the voice may "crack" during this time. This is a temporary
            condition and will improve over time.

            2.As the hormones of puberty increase, adolescents may experience an
            increase in oily skin and sweating. This is a normal part of
            growing. It is important to wash daily, including the face. Acne may
            develop.

            3.As the penis enlarges, the adolescent male may begin to experience
            erections. This is when the penis becomes hard and erect because it
            is filled with blood. This is due to hormonal changes and may happen
            when the boy fantasizes about sexual things or for no reason at all.
            This is normal.

            4.During puberty, the male's body also begins making sperm. Semen,
            which is composed of sperm and other bodily fluids, may be released
            during an erection. This is called ejaculation. Sometimes, this may
            happen while the male is sleeping. This is called a nocturnal
            emission or wet dream. This is a normal part of puberty. Once sperm
            is made and ejaculation happens, adolescent males are able to
            reproduce.

          <h4>HAIR, HAIR, EVERYWHERE
          </h4>
          <p> Well, maybe not everywhere. But one of the first signs of puberty
            is hair growing where it didn't grow before. Guys and girls both
            begin to grow hair under their arms and in their pubic areas (on and
            around the genitals). It starts out looking light and sparse. Then
            as you go through puberty, it becomes longer, thicker, heavier, and
            darker. Eventually, guys also start to grow hair on their faces.
            ABOUT FACES
            1.Another thing that comes with puberty is acne, or pimples. Acne is
            triggered by puberty hormones. Pimples usually start around the
            beginning of puberty and can stick around during adolescence (the
            teen years).

            2.You may notice pimples on your face, your upper back, or your
            upper chest. It helps to keep your skin clean, and your doctor will
            be able to offer some suggestions for clearing up acne. The good
            news about acne is that it usually gets better or disappears by the
            end of adolescence.
