              <h4>How you can support your child during puberty</h4>
              <p>One of the best strategies during your child’s puberty is
                reassurance and ensuring they know you are a safe adult that
                they can trust to share difficult conversations, without fear of
                judgement or embarrassment.
    
                Explaining that puberty is an exciting time that means adulthood
                is approaching can be a positive way to introduce this time of
                change.
    
                Try to show compassion for the changes they’re experiencing and
                reassure them the changes are normal, and that many are only
                temporary.</p>
    
              <p>You may also find it useful to keep the following tips in mind:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Praise your teenager for their efforts, achievements and
                  positive behaviour.</li>
                <li>Put yourself in your child’s shoes. If you experience them
                  pushing back on boundaries, try to see their behaviour for
                  what
                  it often is: your child struggling to become an individual.</li>
                <li>Try to stay calm during angry outbursts from your child.
                  Wait
                  for your child to cool down before talking about the problem.</li>
                <li>They will be learning how to regulate their own emotions
                  from
                  how you react when there is conflict in the home.</li>
                <li>Stay interested and involved in your child’s life, and
                  always
                  let them know you are available if they want to talk.</li>
                <li>Chat to your partner or other parents of teenagers. Sharing
                  concerns and experiences can help normalise the process and
                  make
                  you feel more supported, in turn you can support your young
                  person.</li>
                <li>Try to support your child in their self-expression, even if
                  some
                  of it seems odd to you, such as an extreme haircut or strange
                  or
                  different clothing choices.</li>
                <li>Try to tolerate long periods of time spent on personal care,
                  such as hours in the bathroom, but chat to your child about
                  reasonable family time limits.</li>
                <li>Talk to your child about any permanent changes they want to
                  make
                  to their body, such a tattoos and piercings, and discuss
                  temporary alternatives, such as henna (removable) tattoos.</li>
                <li>If your child has acne, talk to them about how they feel
                  about
                  it. If it is bothering them, ask if they would like to see a
                  doctor. Your doctor may refer your teenager to a skin
                  specialist
                  or dermatologist.</li>

        <h4>How you can support your daughter during puberty</h4>
        <p>
            Helping your daughter with firsts, such as being ready for their
            first period can be a very important time for the relationship
            between a parent and their daughter.<br>Help them prepare by providing them with information and having conversations about periods being nothing to be ashamed of,
            being an important ritual for young women and a normal part of
            becoming an adult. Provide them with sanitary items for home and
            school, and explain how to use them hygienically (for example,
            having clean hands when using tampons, or not sleeping with one
            in place).<br>Discuss how cramping and other mood changes may accompany the
            time of bleeding each month, and explore ways to relieve pain,
            such as a hot water bottle.

          <h4>How you can support your son during puberty </h4>
          <p>  Helping your son through puberty is mostly about reassurance.
            Reassure your son that testes develop unevenly, and it’s
            common for one to be lower than the other. If your son’s
            testes are very small or not both in the scrotum, see your GP. <br>You may also need to reassure your son that penis size does
            not affect sexual functioning, and that erect penises are
            usually very similar in size. Every boy develops in his own
            time. Ejaculating during sleep (sometimes called a wet dream)
            and spontaneous erections are both normal. <br>Having conversations about gender and how this is viewed in
            our society can be important, as there are stereotypes and
            conditioning that can impact a young person’s confidence
            through these pubescent changes.<br>If your son experiences breast growth or tenderness, he may be
            concerned. Again, reassurance and normalising the experience
            is the key. Any tenderness is likely to settle once his chest
            widens. If your son feels small or too thin for his age,
            reassure him he will grow in time.

          <h4>How to look after yourself at this time </h4>
          <p> Puberty is the beginning of your child’s transformation into
            an adult. Take some time to accept that your child, and your
            role as parent and your family dynamic, is changing. <br>You may also need to accept that you won’t have total control
            over your child’s choices and life direction once they’re a
            young adult.<br>Some tips for ways to take care of yourself:
            <ul>
                <li>Prepare a weekly family plan, so you know what people are
                  doing and where they need to be. Include some fun family
                  rituals, like Saturday night cards, or maybe a weekly walk
                  or bike ride. Don’t forget to schedule some time for
                  yourself.</li>
                <li>Nurture your relationship with your partner. Remember,
                  they’re facing many of the same challenges that you are. A
                  regular date night in your family schedule can be very
                  helpful to deepen your connection and ability to support
                  each other as parents and as romantic partners.</li>
                <li>Use your support networks, like grandparents, other family
                  members and friends. What child (including your teenager)
                  doesn’t enjoy being spoiled by a doting grandparent? You
                  could also share carpooling or supervision duties with
                  friends.</li>
                <li>
                  Ask the kids to help out with household chores. Your child
                  will learn some new skills, gain some new responsibility,
                  and it will lighten the load for you as parents and carers.
                  Focusing on positive reinforcement for tasks done well
                  rather than punishment for tasks not done has been shown to
                  be a more effective method of parenting where appropriate.
                </li>
                <li>Stay positive and keep things in perspective. Adolescence
                  does not last forever, and it is a temporary stage in your
                  young person’s life.</li>
              </ul>

          <h4>How to foster positive independence during puberty </h4>
           <p> It’s normal for your child to want more independence – but
            still need your support – during puberty or teen years. They
            may take risks as they explore their boundaries.<br> As a parent, you may be worried about your child’s safety,
            and find yourself arguing with them about their push for
            independence. Try to stay calm and work through the issues
            with your child. If your child or you are emotional and upset,
            it is better for everyone to walk away and calm down before
            continuing a conversation.<br>Communicate openly, and make sure your child knows you’re there for them. Stay available, because being accessible is a
            great way for your young person to use you for support. It
            also helps you to find out what your child is doing and keep
            them safe. <br>Talk to your child about making good decisions, and your
            family’s values. Ask your child to tell you where they are and
            what they’re doing, and agree before they go out on reasonable
            limits, such as a return time. If your young person doesn’t
            stick to the initial agreement, use that as learning for what
            they can do differently or better next time.
