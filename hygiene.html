              <h4>Why good personal hygiene matters?</h4>
              <p>Keeping clean is an important part of staying healthy. For
                example, the simple act of washing hands before eating and after
                using the toilet is a proven and effective way of fighting off
                germs and avoiding sickness. <br>
                Being clean is also an important part of confidence for
                    teenagers.
                    If your child’s body and breath smell OK, their clothes are clean,
                    and they're on top of their basic personal hygiene, it can help
                    your
                    child feel comfortable with other people. <br><br>
                    Learning the importance of personal hygiene for teens is essential
                    to help them maintain good health. Personal hygiene is a set of
                    practices used to keep one’s body clean, promote good health, and
                    avoid disease <br>(1). Children pay attention to basic personal
                    hygiene routines until late childhood, such as coughing while
                    covering their mouths and washing hands after meals.
        
                   However, when they enter adolescence, this list expands to
                    include
                    certain new habits critical to the teen’s health and well-being.
                    You
                    may assist your teen in developing a good personal hygiene regimen
                    as a parent. This post discusses the importance of teenagers
                    maintaining personal hygiene, how they can do so, parents’ role in
                    this endeavor.

        <h4>Types Of Personal Hygiene For  Teenagers</h4>
        <p>Personal hygiene is a dynamic term that encompasses several types
            of self-hygiene practices such as bathing, washing hands, brushing
            teeth, etc. Following are the various categories of good hygiene
            habits</p>
            
          <ol>
            <li>
            <div class="left">
               <b>Skincare:</b>  The skin of teenagers might get oilier as they attain
              puberty. Oily skin traps dust and dirt and thus serves as a
              breeding ground for germs. It leads to the development of
              several skin issues, such as acne and blackheads. Therefore, it
              is good for a teen to develop a proper skincare routine by
              regularly washing their face with mild soap or facial cleanser
              and water. Consult a dermatologist if the teen faces persistent
              skin issues. The doctor can prescribe appropriate skincare
              products, such as mild acne cleansers and creams.
            </div>               
              
            </li>
            <li>
              Haircare: Teenagers go out more often than children. This way,
              their hair (as well as skin) tends to become dirty. Also,
              hormonal changes might make the hair oily and smelly. The
              thickness of the hair only compounds the problem. Therefore,
              encourage your teen to wash their hair with a mild shampoo twice
              or thrice a week. They may also nurture their hair by applying
              some homemade or other hair care products after consulting a
              trichologist (hair doctor).
            </li>
           
            <li>
              Nail care: Teenage is the time when they like to grow their
              nails, style them into different shapes, and design them.
              However, fingernails are an ideal breeding ground for germs.
              These germs can transfer into the mouth while eating with hands.
              Touching the face can also cause the germs to get into the
              mouth, eyes, and nose, or on the skin. Thus, it is necessary for
              your teen to have a nail care routine. They can scrub the dirt
              out using a nail brush. Besides, a weekly clipping should help
              get rid of dirt and reduce the possibility of painful ingrown
              nails.
            </li>

            <li>
              Oral care: Poor dental care can lead to problems such as bad
              breath and tooth decay. Make your child brush and floss their
              teeth twice a day. They should also wash their mouth after
              meals, either with plain water or with a mouthwash.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Washing hands: Hands can spread germs to almost any part of the
              body. It is necessary to wash hands before and after meals,
              after playing outdoors, after feeding or playing with pets,
              after using the toilet and after any other situation where they
              touch a contaminated surface. Create a fun hand washing routine
              so that teens do not try to bypass it.
            </li>
           
            <li>
              Bathing: Body odor develops due to the development of a new type
              of sweat gland during adolescence, in the armpits and genital
              areas. The bacteria on the skin feed on the compounds in the
              sweat from these regions and cause body odor. Therefore, you
              need to explain to your teen that bathing or showering,
              especially after physical activity, helps remove sweat and
              bacteria and prevents body odor. They may also use an
              antiperspiranti to control sweat production or deodorant to
              prevent body odor.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Toilet hygiene: This might not be a new hygiene practice for
              teens; however, it needs to be updated once they hit puberty.
              They should be advised on wiping their genitals every time after
              using the toilet and washing them while bathing as teens
              normally have some secretions from their genitals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Menstrual hygiene: Teaching menstrual hygiene to a teenage girl
              involves guiding them to track their periods, use hygiene
              products such as a sanitary pad (reusable or disposable), or
              tampon, and their safe disposal after use. A teenage girl should
              also be given directions on the correct usage of these products,
              and their frequency of changing these products
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Shave safe: Teenage boys can develop a mustache or beard,
              depending on their hair growth. If the boy wishes to shave, then
              you can buy them shaving cream and a teen-friendly razor. Teach
              them how to shave their facial hair carefully without inflicting
              injuries. Similarly, teen girls, who want to remove their
              underarm hair, need to be told about the importance of using
              sterilized equipment and to be careful while shaving their
              genital area, and to avoid removing this unless absolutely
              necessary. You can teach them proper pubic hair grooming
              techniques to avoid shaving accidents. Also, teach them about
              after-shave skin care routine and why they should not be sharing
              their paraphernaliai with others.
            </li>
            
            
            <li>
              Clean clothes and shoes: It is important to change clothes,
              especially undergarments and socks, every day. Clothes retain
              dead skin cells, sweat, and other body fluids that can harbor
              germs. Teens who wear clean clothes and shoes can effectively
              combat puberty-related issues such as body odor and smelly feet.
              Maintaining clothing hygiene can also make you feel refreshed.

          <h4>Why Do Teens Face Personal Hygiene Issues? </h4>
          <p>The following are some of the common causes for teens to face
            personal hygiene issues.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Lack of awareness: This is one of the most common reasons for a
              teen to show disinterest in personal hygiene. The teen may not
              be aware of the importance of hygiene and the steps they need to
              take in this regard.
            </li>
            <li>
              Habit of procrastination: They may tend to postpone their bath
              or avoid taking a bath or brushing their hair if they have no
              plans of going out for the day. They may take it easy on washing
              their hands after using the toilet or before eating. These
              instances might be fewer in teens who have been oriented into
              personal hygiene from a younger age itself.
            </li>
            <li>
              Delay in cognitive development or mental health problems: Some
              teens may have an issue in maintaining basic hygiene routine due
              to cognitive development delay or some mental health problems
              such as depression. In such special cases, either the teen is
              not able to understand the importance of personal hygiene, or
              they forget the steps to perform the practice.

          <h4>How To Talk To Your Teen About
            Personal Hygiene? </h4>
            <p>
                You may take the following steps to talk to a teen about personal
                hygiene.
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>The best phase to strike a conversation about personal hygiene
                  is at the beginning of puberty. It can ensure that by the time
                  your tween enters adolescence, they are well-prepared for the
                  changes they might experience.</li>
                <li>Do a quick research on the issue that you want to discuss. It
                  will help you share correct information with your teen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Pick a quiet and alone time for the conversation. A teen who is
                  at ease can participate in the conversation comfortably.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep the participants of the conversation limited to you and the
                  teen to respect their privacy. It will also help your teen
                  develop trust in you, and they will likely confide in you in the
                  future as well.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Share your observations and tell them how poor hygiene habits
                  could become a problem. However, while talking, ensure that you
                  do not make it seem shameful and embarrassing. It is good to
                  start your conversation by praising your teen and then slowly
                  progress to the areas that need improvement.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Share about the social aspects of hygiene. Share live examples
                  and be a role model. Guide them with examples of how hygiene is
                  important for physical, physiological, mental, and social
                  health. For example, when you talk about oral hygiene
                  activities, talk about a relative or friend, who ended up going
                  for a root canal treatment because they were not brushing and
                  flossing their teeth.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Once you have shared your part, ask your tween or teen if they
                  have any questions or suggestions to make. Listen to them
                  patiently and make them feel heard. Try to answer what you can
                  and show that you are willing to help them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Be supportive and continue to communicate about their personal
                  needs. Bring them all necessary personal hygiene items as per
                  their needs. Take your teen along for shopping for their
                  personal care products.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Praise and reward the teen appropriately when you see positive
                  changes. If the teen does not improve, then set some strict
                  hygiene rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Seek a professional’s help if you observe any erratic behavior
                  related to personal hygiene that you cannot sort out.
                </li>
